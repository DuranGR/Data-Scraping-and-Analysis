# Data-Scraping-and-Analysis
This is an university project where I got the average grades from the past two years in Brazil's National High School Exam.
After doing some Web Scrapping through beautiful Soup I started the data treatment by organizing the information in a way 
for me to organize a graph comparing the grades from both years in each area (e.g: Medicine, Information Systems).
